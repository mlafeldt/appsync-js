[AWS AppSync provides two libraries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-reference-overview-js.html#utility-resolvers) that aid in the development of resolvers with the `APPSYNC_JS` runtime:

- **@aws-appsync/eslint-plugin** - Catches and fixes problems quickly during development.

- **@aws-appsync/utils** - Provides type validation and autocompletion in code editors.

This repo tracks the source code of these libraries.
